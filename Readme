Did not account for scenarios where 
[1] Payload is not valid JsonArray, 
[2] Payload is empty JsonArray, 
[3] Payload has JsonObjects that have null fields, 
[4] Payload has JsonObjects that have different field names
[5] Payload has JsonObjects that have field values that are diff from expected (e.g. String instead of int)
